    <section class="introduction">
        <p class="intro__desc">Ocean Rasso has energized and equipped liberty-minded Young Adults across the nation and beyond with his passionate teaching and unwavering commitment to constitutional principles. Widely recognized as one of the foremost educators on America's charters of freedom.
Paul McCormick referred to Ocean as a "Navy Seal of wisdom ."

Alexa Godkin, a prominent grassroots leader, said, "Ocean's" knowledge of the Constitution, along with his ability to present it using humor, audience engagement, and in-depth explanation, is the best I've ever seen."

With more than 300 speaking engagements under his belt, Ocean delivers a powerful and resonant message of freedomâ€”one that ignites unity and action in the hearts of Americans determined to safeguard our republic. His compelling vision inspires hope and revitalization in a time marked by uncertainty and national challenges.

Bring Ocean to your next event. You'll never be the same after hearing him. </p>

    <h2 class="about__title">About Me and my young Life</h2>
    <section class="about__me">
        
        <p class="about__para">1879 - the Civil War is over, and the resulting economic explosion spurs the great migration west.
             Farmers, ranchers, prospectors, killers, and thieves seek their fortune. Cattle growers turn cow towns into armed
             camps, with murder rates higher than than those of modern day New York or Los Angeles.
             Out of this chaos comes legendary lawman Wyatt Earp, retiring his badge and gun to start
             a peaceful life for his family. Earp's friend, John, Doc Holliday, a southern gentlemen turned
              gunman and gambler, also travels west, hoping the dry climate would relieve his tuberculosis.
               Silver is discovered in Arizona. Tombstone becomes queen of the boom towns where the latest
                Pairs fashions are sold from the backs of wagons. Attracted to this atmosphere of greed,
                 over 100 exiled Texas outlaws band together to form the ruthless gang recognized by the
                  red sashes they wear. They emerge as the earliest example of organized crime in America.
                   They call themselves, The Cowboys. The O.K. Corral gunfight was October 26th, 1881.
